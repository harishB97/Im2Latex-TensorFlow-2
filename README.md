# Im2Markup-TF2
Tensorflow 2 implementation of Im2Markup model described in 2017  ICML paper "[Image-to-Markup Generation with Coarse-to-Fine Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04938)"

The model has been built using the original implementation from [here](https://github.com/harvardnlp/im2markup) and Tensorflow-1 implementation from [here](https://github.com/aspnetcs/myim2latex-tensorflow-docker) as references.

Model building, training as well as validation has been included in the notebook "Im2Markup_tf2.ipynb"

Download the tfrecord files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQ3qvM6wpvsL4XbREGfVfJhybDWjUapH?usp=sharing) and move to "100K_tfrecords_v3" folder before training.

### Preferred versions (python packages):
---

- Tensorflow => 2.4.1
- Numpy => 1.19.5
