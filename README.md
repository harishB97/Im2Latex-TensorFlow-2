# Im2Latex-TensorFlow-2
TensorFlow-2 implementation of Im2Latex deep learning model described in HarvardNLP paper **"[What You Get Is What You See:
A Visual Markup Decompiler]([https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04938](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04938v1.pdf))"** which can generate latex code from images of mathematical expressions 

The model has been built referring the **[Original implementation by HarvardNLP in Torch (Lua)](https://github.com/harvardnlp/im2markup)** and **[TensorFlow-1 implementation](https://github.com/ritheshkumar95/im2latex-tensorflow)**.

Download the images files from **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18JW6Dn0M1T_YiANeMfM14tjXMnAXxt-l/view?usp=sharing)** and move to "Images" folder before training.

### Preferred versions (python packages):
---

- Tensorflow => 2.4.1
- Numpy => 1.19.5
